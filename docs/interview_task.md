Overview
As a user of the UI currency conversion app
I want to be able to view a list of my last 5 currency conversions
So that I can quickly reference recent conversions without having to redo them.

Acceptance Criteria
The list should show a maximum of 5 most recent currency conversions.
New conversions should be added to the top of the list.
If the list already contains 5 conversions, the oldest conversion should be removed from the bottom of the list to make space for the new one.

Non-Functional Requirements
Usability
The list of conversions should be easily accessible from the main screen.
Entries should be displayed in a clear and readable format.
The from, to, amount to convert, and the API-derived conversion value should all be present.
Scalability
Although the current requirement is to store only the last 5 conversions, the design should be flexible enough to allow easy adjustments to this number in the future if needed.

Display latests 5 conversions and display them

`from: number+curr to: number+curr`
